### Parking on a person — the `decision` document (headless)

**Every `needs-decision` park writes one `decision` document, and it is the interview card
in fields.** The person clearing `Blocked · decision` reads this card and nothing else —
not the issue, not the PRD, not the register, not your comment thread. The sentinel's
`summary` is its headline (the rules for it are below); everything a person needs to decide
goes here. Write it to `$FLEET_RESULT_FILE` (skip only if that is unset) before the
done-sentinel:

```json
{
  "kind": "decision",
  "brief": {
    "work":    "What somebody will be able to do that they cannot today, in plain words.",
    "example": "One named person doing it, and what they see.",
    "stopped": "What stopped this run, in plain words — the fork, not the log.",
    "stakes":  "What is at stake either way."
  },
  "context": [
    {"ref": "AC-4", "name": "automated comments never reach the customer",
     "quote": "<the criterion's own text, verbatim>", "url": "<optional https link>"}
  ],
  "question": {
    "id": "<short id>",
    "prompt": "The decision, as one question in plain words.",
    "options": [
      {"id": "<short id>", "label": "<what the person picks, no ids>",
       "why": "<why this is right>", "cost": "<what it costs>",
       "then": "<what happens next if picked>", "recommended": true},
      {"id": "…", "label": "…", "why": "…", "cost": "…", "then": "…", "recommended": false}
    ]
  }
}
```

- **Two to four options, the recommended one first** and the only one marked `true`;
  `why`, `cost` and `then` on **every** option.
- **Quote what you cite.** Every acceptance criterion, requirement, issue or PRD the question
  leans on gets a `context` entry whose `quote` is its own text — or, in prose, the plain name
  with the id in parentheses: *the automated-account rule (<!-- home -->BTR-012<!-- /home -->)*. A bare `AC-4`, <!-- home -->`BTR-012`<!-- else -->`REQ-NNN`<!-- /home -->,
  <!-- home -->`ENG-1234`<!-- else -->`<KEY>`<!-- /home -->, <!-- home -->`PRD 0676`<!-- else -->`PRD NNNN`<!-- /home -->, <!-- home -->`SL-214`<!-- else -->`SL-NNN`<!-- /home -->, `PR #123` or <!-- home -->`/zetify:…`<!-- else -->a bare command name<!-- /home --> is refused.
- **Labels carry no ids at all**, and nothing says where the issue was parked — the fleet
  says that, and the person reading is already there.

**The `summary` is still the first thing a person reads**: on their request's own page, its
Cockpit row and the park list, wherever no card is drawn. So it is written to them, not to the
fleet:

- **One or two plain sentences, addressed to the person**: what Fleet found, then the choice.
- **Name things by their titles, in quotes, never by ids.** No slice, PRD, capability, issue,
  pull request or filing id, not even in parentheses, and none of Fleet's own nouns (slice, PRD
  stub, capability row): a person asked for a plan, a feature, a fix. The ids belong in the
  document's `context`, where the card quotes them.
- **Say what each answer does**: *"Withdraw this request, or send it back if you want … anyway."*

Write *"This use already has a plan, 'Bring the whole local service up with one command',
accepted earlier today. Withdraw this request, or send it back if you want a second plan
anyway."*, never *"Slice SL-NNN, its two PRD stubs and its capability rows already sit on main from the
accepted sibling filing, so this idea's plan would duplicate it"*.

**Check both before the sentinel** and fix every reason it prints, in this turn:

```bash
python3 knowledge/scripts/validate_decision.py --summary "<the summary you will write>" "$FLEET_RESULT_FILE"
```

`0` meets the card; `1` prints every rule broken; `2` means there is no `decision` document at
the path. A park with a missing or refused document still parks — the fleet does not strand a
person's decision over its shape — but the park is recorded as `askRefused` with your reasons,
and that is counted.
