### Writing for people — five rules for every session

- **Write everything that lasts in English.** Whatever language a person writes to you in,
  your live conversation with them may follow it: your questions and your replies. Everything
  that is kept is written in English: the knowledge base, plans and decisions, commit messages,
  pull request titles and descriptions, code comments, and the issues you write. When you record
  what a person said in another language, translate it into English. Keep their exact words as
  a quote only where the wording itself matters.
- **Use plain English.** Write in the style of ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. Many
  readers are not native English speakers. Write so that a busy reader with B1–B2 English
  understands every sentence on the first read. This holds for everything a person reads:
  questions, replies, issues, pull requests, plans, summaries and docs. Simpler words do not mean
  vaguer content. Keep every fact, number and name that matters. The points below are Fleet's
  own use of that style.
  - *Sentences.* One idea per sentence. Keep most sentences under 15 words. If "and", "which"
    or a colon joins two ideas, split the sentence. Use active voice: "She sets a limit", not "A
    limit is set". Use the simple tenses: present, past and future. Avoid forms like "would have
    been". Use a verb, not an "-ing" form used as a noun: "Check the input", not "Do the input
    checking". If you need a hard tense, keep that sentence short.
  - *Instructions and descriptions.* An instruction is a step that a person or an agent must do.
    Write it in the imperative, with one action per sentence, at most 20 words. Put the
    condition first: "If the check fails, run the fix command." A description says what
    something is or does. Write it in at most 25 words, with one topic per paragraph. A promise
    stays at 20 words (the last rule).
  - *Words.* Use everyday words: "use", not "utilize"; "help", not "facilitate"; "start", not
    "initiate". Never write leverage, robust, seamless, delve, utilize, facilitate, streamline,
    empower, holistic, synergy or cutting-edge. Prefer a verb to a noun made from a verb: "she
    checks", not "she performs a check". Name the concrete thing: "error message", not "the
    refusal"; "script", not "the loop". Use a technical term only if the reader needs it, and
    explain it in a few plain words the first time. Use the same word for the same thing every
    time. Do not switch between "limit", "cap" and "allowance".
  - *Clarity.* Every "it", "this" and "they" must point to one thing. If in doubt, repeat the
    noun. Put the main point first, then the details. Give a concrete example instead of an
    abstract description. Cut filler: "in order to", "it is important to note that",
    "basically", "actually".
  - *Structure.* Keep paragraphs to 2–4 sentences. Use bullet lists for steps or options, not
    for an explanation that flows.
  - *One word, one meaning.* Use one approved word for one thing, in every document. Do not
    use the words on its right for that thing. Words in code, in quotes and in a customer's own
    wording stay as they are.
    - **issue** — not: ticket
    - **person** — not: user, human
    - **machine** — not: host, node
    - **pull request** — not: PR
    - **repository** — not: repo
    - **agent** — not: bot
    - **customer** — not: client
    - **sign in** — not: log in, login
    - **limit** — not: cap, allowance
    - **mockup** — not: wireframe, prototype
    - **knowledge base** — not: wiki
  - *Examples.*
    "We leverage the cache in order to facilitate faster lookups." → "The cache makes lookups
    faster."
    "A limit is enforced on a per-key basis." → "Each key has its own limit."
    "The update was performed after validation of the input, which can fail." → "The worker
    checks the input first. If the check fails, nothing is updated."
    "It was rejected." → "The check rejected the pull request."
  - *Final check.* Before you send, reread each sentence. Is it within its length limit? Does it hold
    one idea? Would a non-native reader know every word? Does it use the approved words? If not, rewrite it.
- **Never write a real customer's name.** Not the company, and not its hosts, organisations,
  repositories, people or install names. This holds for code, comments, tests,
  commit messages, pull request text and release notes. When you record where a problem was
  seen, write "a customer install". When an example or a test needs a name, use a made-up one
  such as `acme` or `example.com`.
- **Write for a reader who does not know the code.** Pull request descriptions, issue titles,
  questions, feature descriptions and requirement text are read by people who never opened this
  repository. Keep our internal names out of the sentence: no PRD or issue id (a `PRD` number,
  an issue key), no process word ("slice", "lane", "dispatch"), no file path, check name or run
  id (`tests/e2e/specs/…`, `CI / e2e - browser suite`, `run 0253bb04`). Say what the thing is in
  the product's words, and name the effect on a person, not the mechanism. An id or path a
  reader needs — to link an issue, to point at evidence — goes on its own references line or in
  a references section at the end, never in the sentence a person reads first; a linking key a
  tool requires stays as a label at the start. Before you send: would somebody who has never
  opened this repository understand it? If not, rewrite it.
- **Write a promise in one plain sentence.** A capability, a requirement rule and a journey's
  acceptance criterion are read by people who did not write the code and checked by a QA agent
  from outside it. Write each as one sentence of at most 20 words, in the product's words:
  pages, buttons, issues, keys, workers. Code names, routes, status codes, environment variables,
  setting keys and file paths go in the Evidence column, never in the sentence. Keep who, what,
  when and every exception. Write a limit someone may tune as "a time limit"; keep the number
  only when the number is the promise. Say who acts: an operator, a person, an agent, a worker.
  The same words hold for what a customer reads about a feature: its brief, each use's name and
  paragraph, and a plan's slices and pieces of work. A person's own words are reworded to this
  standard before they are proposed, never written as they came.
  The full standard, with examples, is *Wording a promise* in `process/knowledge-bootstrap-formats.md`.
